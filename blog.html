        1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const ?
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>Before we Discuss about the scope of var , let and const we need to know just what exacty is a scope. In this
          course we learned that there are two types of scope , Global Scope and Block scope.

          <br>
          <br>
          Now Var can be accessed from aywhere from the function since its a Global scope, while on the other hand both
          Let and Const are block scope , so they cant be acessed from anywhere , only from its respected block
          function.

        </p>

    <div class="collapse collapse-plus mb-5 bg-base-200">

        2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined ?
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>Null basically means an empty value or a blank value.
          <br>
          And Undefiend Means the variable (can be either of var ,let ,const) has been declared, but its value has not
          been assigned.
          <br>
          <br>

          Null is a primitive data type object in JavaScript. A null value in JavaScript is used for
          referring absence of any object value and if any function or variable returns null, then we can infer that the
          object has an empty value or a blank value.

        3. What do you mean by REST API?
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>API stands for application programming interface.
          <br>
           API is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other.

           <br>
           <br>
           A REST API is a type of API that follows some specific types of  guidelines. REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It means that when a client requests a resource using a REST API, the server transfers back the current state of the resource in a standardized representation.REST api uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data. REST api is popular because of their simplicity, scalability, speed, and ability to handle all data types.
